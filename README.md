# Associative Domain Adaptation in PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of "Associative Domain Adaptation" [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00938).
Right now, it features the `SVHN -> MNIST` transfer as described in the paper.
The results line up the the ones reported in the paper, even slightly better at `Accuracy: 98.06 % / Error: 1.94 %` on the MNIST Validation set.

This implementation is meant to be minimalistic, for easy adaptation to other projects.

To train a model with standard settings, execute

```
> python train.py
```

Notes: 

- The hyperparameters where loosely inspired by the ones reported in the original publication, but not too much finetuning was necessary to get to this result.
- Note the use of the InstanceNormalization layer, which is similar, but not exactly similar to the reference implementation provided by the authors.
